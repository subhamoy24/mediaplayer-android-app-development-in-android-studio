# mediaplayer-android-app-development-in-android-studio
I did a midaplayer app in android studio.it is a app in which  it fetches all the mp3 or any type of audio file which you stored in your android device if you allow it to access your files.it is easy to handle.all the audio files are there in serial manner.if you want listen a audio you just click the start button and if you try to forward the you can,just pulling the seekbar.ok... it so cool
